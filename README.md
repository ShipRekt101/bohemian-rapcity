## Rap City
Real time rap lyric generator  (*based on the original "rap-app"*) 

##### How it works
1. Receives rap lyric input from the user using speech recognition
2. Analyzes the input and searches for a word that rhymes with the previous line
3. Outputs lyric that rhymes with the user's input to mimic intelligent "freestyle"


##### History
Rap City is a continuation of "the-rap-app" -- a hackathon project [*Cal Hacks, October 2015*] created by three UC Berkeley students: Sam Choi, Owen Jow, and Sagang Wee. the-rap-app was able to respond with a single word that rhymed with the last word of the user's sentence. Thus, Rap City is an attempt to improve on the-rap-app to create the perfect freestyle-rap partner.
